    (ODT)** from a yWriter 7 project.

-   Load yWriter 7 chapters and scenes into an OpenDocument file with
    chapter and scene markers for **proof reading** and writing back.

-   Generate a **character list** that can be edited in Office Calc and
    written back to yWriter format.

-   Generate a **location list** that can be edited in Office Calc and
    written back to yWriter format.

-   Generate an OpenDocument text file containing navigable **cross
    references** , such as scenes per character, characters per tag,
    etc.

-   Generate a new yWriter 7 project from a **work in progress** or an
    **outline** .
