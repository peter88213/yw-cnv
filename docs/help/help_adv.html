<h2 id="warning">Warning!</h2>

<p id="warning">
The "advanced features" are meant to be used by experienced OpenOffice/LibreOffice users only. 
If you aren't familiar with <b>Calc</b> and the concept of <b>sections in Writer</b>, please do not use the advanced features. 
There is a risk of damaging the project when writing back if you don't respect the section boundaries 
in the ODT text documents, or if you mess up the IDs in the ODS tables. Be sure to try out the features 
with a test project first.</p>

<h3>Plotting conventions</h3>

<p>In yWriter, you can divide your novel into <strong>Plot Sections</strong> (e.g. acts or steps) by 
inserting chapters marked "other". They will show up in blue color and won't get exported.</p>

<p><strong>Plot-related events</strong> (e.g. "Mid Point", "Climax") can be identified by "scene tags" 
if you want to link them to a specific scene.</p>

<p>You can use scene notes for <strong>plot-specific explanations</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>visualize character arcs</strong>, you can use the project's rating names 
by changing them to the names of up to four main characters. Then you can quantify the state of these 
four characters and put them into the scenes. It's easy then to let OpenOffice Calc show a diagram for 
the scene ratings over scene count or word count.</p>

<ul>
<li>Only rating field names corresponding to character names or containing the string "story", e.g. 
"A-Story", "BStoryline" (up to 10 case insensitive characters) appear in the plot list.</li>

<li>Only ratings greater than 1 appear in the plot list, i.e. 1 means "a rating is not set for 
this chapter".</li>

<li>Recommended ratings:
<ul>
<li>1 = N/A</li>
<li>2 = unhappy</li>
<li>3 = dissatisfied</li>
<li>4 = vague</li>
<li>5 = satisfied</li>
<li>6 = happy</li>
</ul>
<li>Ratings deleted while editing the plotlist will be converted to 1 on writing back.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can write back the edited table to the yWriter 6/7 project file with the <a href="help.html#export_to_ywriter">
Export to yWriter</a> command.</p>
