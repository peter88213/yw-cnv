<p>This will load yWriter 6/7 chapters and scenes into a new OpenDocument text document (odt).</p>

<ul>
<li>The document is placed in the same folder as the yWriter project.</li>
<li>Document's <strong>filename</strong>: <code>&#139;yW project name&#155;.odt</code>.</li>
<li>Text markup: Bold and italics are supported. Other highlighting such as underline and strikethrough are lost.</li>
<li>Only "normal" chapters and scenes are imported. Chapters and scenes marked "unused", "todo" or "notes" are not 
imported.</li>
<li>Only scenes that are intended for RTF export in yWriter will be imported.</li>
<li>Comments in the text bracketed with slashes and asterisks (like <code>/* this is a comment */</code>) are 
converted to author's comments.</li>
<li>Interspersed HTML, TEX, or RTF commands are taken over unchanged.</li>
<li>Gobal variables and project variables are not resolved.</li>
<li>Chapter titles appear as first level heading if the chapter is marked as beginning of a new section in 
yWriter. Such headings are considered as "part" headings.</li>
<li>Chapter titles appear as second level heading if the chapter is  not marked as beginning of a new section. 
Such headings are considered as "chapter" headings.</li>
<li>Scene titles appear as navigable comments pinned to the beginning of the scene.</li>
<li>Usually, scenes are separated by blank lines. The first line is not indented.</li>
<li>Starting from the second paragraph, paragraphs begin with indentation of the first line.</li>
<li>Scenes marked "attach to previous scene" in yWriter appear like continuous paragraphs.</li>
