<p>This writes back the document's content to the yWriter project file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure not to change a generated document's file name before writing back to yWriter format.</li>
<li>The yWriter 7 project to rewrite must exist in the same folder as the document.</li>
<li>If the document's file name has no suffix, the document is considered a <a href="#how-to-set-up-a-work-in-progress-for-export">Work in progress</a> or an <a href="#how-to-set-up-an-outline-for-export">Outline</a> to be exported into a newly created yWriter project. <strong>Note:</strong> Existing yWriter projects will not be overwritten.</li>

<li>Chapter titles appear as first level heading if the chapter is marked as beginning of a new section in yWriter. Such headings are considered as "part" headings.</li>
<li>Chapter titles appear as second level heading if the chapter is not marked as beginning of a new section. Such headings are considered as "chapter" headings.</li>
<li>Scene titles appear as navigable comments pinned to the beginning of the scene.</li>
<li>Scenes are separated by <code>* * *</code>. The first line is not indented. You can replace the scene separators by blank lines with the menu command <strong>Format &gt; Replace scene dividers with blank lines</strong>.</li>
